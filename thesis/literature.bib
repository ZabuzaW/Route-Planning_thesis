Two main approaches that transform the problems into shortest path problems are reviewed, including issues like the modeling of realistic details (e.g., train transfers) and further optimization criteria (e.g., the number of transfers). An important topic is also multi-criteria optimization, where in general all attractive connections with respect to several criteria shall be determined. Finally, we discuss the performance of the described algorithms, which is crucial for their application in a real system.",

However, on the long run, we are interested in planning routes in a multi-modal scenario: we start by car to reach the nearest train station, ride the train to the airport, fly to an airport near our destination and finally take a taxi. In other words, we need to incorporate public transportation into road networks. However, we do not want to switch the type of transportation too often. We end up in a label constrained variant of the shortest path problem. In this work, we present a first efficient solution to a restricted variant of this problem including experimental results for transportation networks with up to 125 Mio. edges.",

  abstract="We survey recent advances in algorithms for route planning in transportation networks. For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.",

We take into account many realistic features like: traffic days, walking between stations, queries between geographic locations instead of a source and a target station, and multi-criteria cost functions. Our algorithm is based on two key observations: (1) many shortest paths share the same transfer pattern, i.e., the sequence of stations where a change of vehicle occurs; (2) direct connections without change of vehicle can be looked up quickly. We precompute the respective data; in practice, this can be done in time linear in the network size, at the expense of a small fraction of non-optimal results. We have accelerated public transportation routing on Google Maps with a system based on our ideas. We report experimental results for three data sets of various kinds and sizes.",

  abstract = "We present a route planning technique solely based on the concept of node contraction. The nodes are first ordered by `importance'. A hierarchy is then generated by iteratively contracting the least important node. Contracting a node v means replacing shortest paths going through v by shortcuts. We obtain a hierarchical query algorithm using bidirectional shortest-path search. The forward search uses only edges leading to more important nodes and the backward search uses only edges coming from more important nodes. For fastest routes in road networks, the graph remains very sparse throughout the contraction process using rather simple heuristics for ordering the nodes. We have five times lower query times than the best previous hierarchical Dijkstra-based speedup techniques and a negative space overhead, i.e., the data structure for distance computation needs less space than the input graph. CHs can be combined with many other route planning techniques, leading to improved performance for many-to-many routing, transit-node routing, goal-directed routing or mobile and dynamic scenarios.",

	abstract = {When you drive to somewhere far away, you will leave your current location via one of only a few important traffic junctions. Starting from this informal observation, we developed an algorithmic approach, transit node routing, that allows us to reduce quickest path queries in road networks to a small number of table lookups. For road maps of Western Europe and the United States, our best query times improved over the best previously published figures by two orders of magnitude. This is also more than one million times faster than the best known algorithm for general networks.},

  abstract = "Transit Node Routing (TNR) is a fast and exact distance oracle for road networks. We show several new results for TNR. First, we give a surprisingly simple implementation fully based on contraction hierarchies that speeds up preprocessing by an order of magnitude approaching the time for just finding a contraction hierarchy (which alone has two orders of magnitude larger query time). We also develop a very effective purely graph theoretical locality filter without any compromise in query times. Finally, we show that a specialization to the online many-to-one (or one-to-many) shortest path problem.",
