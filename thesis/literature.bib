  abstract="We give an overview of models and efficient algorithms for optimally solving timetable information problems like ``given a departure and an arrival station as well as a departure time, which is the connection that arrives as early as possible at the arrival station?'' Two main approaches that transform the problems into shortest path problems are reviewed, including issues like the modeling of realistic details (e.g., train transfers) and further optimization criteria (e.g., the number of transfers). An important topic is also multi-criteria optimization, where in general all attractive connections with respect to several criteria shall be determined. Finally, we discuss the performance of the described algorithms, which is crucial for their application in a real system.",

  abstract="Recent research on fast route planning algorithms focused either on road networks or on public transportation. However, on the long run, we are interested in planning routes in a multi-modal scenario: we start by car to reach the nearest train station, ride the train to the airport, fly to an airport near our destination and finally take a taxi. In other words, we need to incorporate public transportation into road networks. However, we do not want to switch the type of transportation too often. We end up in a label constrained variant of the shortest path problem. In this work, we present a first efficient solution to a restricted variant of this problem including experimental results for transportation networks with up to 125 Mio. edges.",

  abstract="We survey recent advances in algorithms for route planning in transportation networks. For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.",
