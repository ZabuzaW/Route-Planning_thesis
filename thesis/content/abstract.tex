\begin{abstract}\quad\\
	We present algorithms for \multiModal route planning
	in road and public transit networks, as well as in combined networks.
	
	Therefore, we explore the nearest neighbor and shortest path problem
	and propose solutions based on {\coverTree}s, \alt and \csa.
	
	Further, we illustrate the theory behind the algorithms, give a short
	overview of other techniques, present experimental results and compare
	the techniques with each other.
