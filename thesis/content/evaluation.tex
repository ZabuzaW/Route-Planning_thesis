% Evaluation
\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}
	In this section we report on our experimental results for the presented algorithms on three data sets of increasing size.
	Therefore, we first give insights on the data sets and how the network models are obtained. Afterwards we evaluate
	{\coverTree}s, \dijkstra, \astar (with $\asTheCrowFlies$), \alt, \csa and \multiModal methods such as the adopted \dijkstra
	and our simplified version of \anr on the given data sets.\\\\
	When evaluating shortest path queries on randomly chosen source and target nodes, the resulting paths tend to be long-range.
	However, in practice most queries are only local and algorithms like \dijkstra do not scale well with increasing range.
	To overcome this measurement problem, we introduce the notion of a \textit{Dijkstra rank} \libref{dijkstraRank}.
	\begin{mydef}\label{dijkstraRank}
		Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, the \textnormal{Dijkstra rank} of a node $v \in V$ is the number of the iteration in which,
		when running \dijkstra on the graph, it is polled from the priority queue (see \textbf{line 7} of \algoref{dijkstra}).
		
		That is the position $i$ for $v_i$ in the order of vertices when sorted ascending by their distance to the source, i.e.
		\begin{align*}
			v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{|V|}
		\end{align*}
		with $\dist(v_i) \le \dist(v_{i + 1})$ for all $i$.
	\end{mydef}\quad\\
	Instead of choosing queries randomly, we only choose source nodes randomly and then select targets by their
	\textit{Dijkstra rank} to the source. Queries can then be sorted by the \textit{Dijkstra rank} and, by that,
	evaluated in terms of increasing range.

%Input data
\subsection{Input data}
	We consider three data sets, consisting of road and public transit data. The road network is extracted from \osm \libref{osm}
	formatted data and transit data is given in the \gtfs \libref{gtfs} format.\\\\
	Our data sets represent the region around the german cities \freiburgR and \stuttgartR. Their road network is
	of similar size, while our transit data for \freiburgR only includes tram data, whereas the data for \stuttgartR
	also includes train and bus connections. The size of our transit network for \stuttgartR is about ten times the size of
	the network for \freiburgR.
	
	Furthermore, we include a road and transit network for the country \switzerlandR. The transit data consists of train, tram and
	bus connections. Both networks are about three times the size of the {\stuttgartR}s.\\\\
	We obtain our road networks from \libref{freiburgRoadSource, stuttgartRoadSource, switzerlandRoadSource}
	and our transit networks from \libref{freiburgTransitSource, switzerlandTransitSource}.
	The transit data used for \stuttgartR is under restricted public access (refer to \libref{vvsContact}).

	A small \osm example data set is shown by \lstref{osmExample}. Ways are used to represent roads consisting
	of nodes. Tags are used to describe metadata like speed limits for a road or whether it is a one-way street or not.
	However, the format also contains a lot of data not directly relevant for route planning, like shapes of buildings
	and outlines of public parks. Therefore, we filter \osm data and only keep relevant information.
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Tag filter for \osm ways.},label={osmFilter},style={FilterStyle},mathescape={true},

	As we are only interested in the road network itself, we start by reading the ways. We filter them based on the tags
	described by \lstref{osmFilter}. Ways having at least one of the key-value pairs described under \textit{$--$KEEP}
	and none of the pairs under \textit{$--$DROP} are kept, as they represent roads of the network. All other ways are
	rejected, as well as all relations.
	After that, we read the nodes and only keep nodes that occurred at least once in any of the ways that passed the filter.
	Our road network is then build using the remaining nodes as graph nodes, translating the ways into edges between the nodes.
	
	Ways with a positive \textit{oneway} tag are translated into edges only going into the given direction, else we generate
	both edges for both directions. The cost of an edge is computed as the time it needs to travel the direct distance between
	the source and destination coordinates (see \defref{asTheCrowFlies}) with a certain speed. The speed is determined either
	by a given \textit{maxspeed} tag or the average speed for the road type defined by the \textit{highway} tag.
	Therefore, we use the average speed references shown by \tableref{highwaySpeeds}.

	The size of the resulting road graphs (see \sectionref{roadGraphSec}) for all three data sets is reported in \tableref{osmSize}.
	As seen, filtering the \osm data sets beforehand reduces the size of data that is to be processed by $95\%$ to $97\%$.
	The road graphs have approximately two edges per node. This is due to most streets being two-way streets, thus generating
	two edges per connection between two nodes. Obviously, road junctions are, compared to the amount of nodes, rare and thus,
	multiple edges do only rarely share the same node. The in- and outdegree of nodes is extremely low, mostly $2$ ($\approx 80\%$),
	as seen in \tableref{roadDegree}.

%GTFS
\subsubsection{\gtfs}
	\gtfs \libref{gtfs} is short for General Transit Feed Specification, it defines a common format
	for public transit schedules. It comes compressed as \zip archive, consisting multiple
	text files formatted as \csv tables. The mandatory tables are
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[1.] \textit{agency.txt}, defining metadata about the transit agency;
		\item[2.] \textit{routes.txt}, containing information about complete routes, like all trips belonging to a bus line;
		\item[3.] \textit{trips.txt}, consisting of single trips, belonging to a route;
		\item[4.] \textit{stop\_times.txt}, having departure and arrival times at the stops for all connections in the network;
		\item[5.] \textit{stops.txt}, providing metadata and coordinates of all stops;
		\item[6.] \textit{calendar.txt} defining the service pattern at which routes are available.
	\end{itemize}
	Furthermore, there are a couple of optional tables of which we are only interested in
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[7.] \textit{transfer.txt}, provides transfer possibilities between stops and their duration.

	An example feed can be seen in \lstref{gtfsExample}. The format is similar to our definition of timetables (see \sectionref{timetable_sec}),
	with the difference that connections are not directly given as edges departing from one stop and another, but as pair of arrival and
	departure time at stops. Also, it contains a lot of metadata which we do not process.\\\\
	Construction of a realistic time expanded transit graph (see \defref{realisticTransitGraph}) is straightforward and mainly
	involves around parsing \textit{stop\_times.txt}. We build two nodes for every entry, one representing the arrival event at the stop
	and another for the departure. Furthermore, we create a transfer node for every arrival node, indicating a transfer at the given stop.
	Each arrival node is then connected by an edge with its corresponding departure and transfer node.
	
	After parsing all data, we connect departure nodes with the arrival nodes at the next stop in a trip. Therefore, we
	process each trip and follow the \textit{stop\_times.txt} entries belonging to that trip in the order defined by
	the \textit{stop\_sequence} field.
	
	As a next step, waiting edges are created by sorting transfer nodes of a stop ascending in time and then creating edges
	connecting them in that order. Finally, every departure node is connected to its previous transfer node. We find the
	transfer node by using a \textit{binary search} \libref{binarySearch} on the sorted list of transfer nodes for this stop.\\\\
	Timetables (see \defref{timetable}) are received similar. But simpler, as transfer nodes are not present. We process
	all stops and trips defined in \textit{stops.txt} and \textit{trips.txt} and obtain the sets $S$ and $T$ respectively.
	Connections are created by again processing entries in \textit{stop\_times.txt}, belonging to one trip, in the sequence
	defined by \textit{stop\_sequence}. We create one connection for every departure node with the corresponding
	next arrival node.
	
	For the footpaths, we initially take the transfers given in \textit{transfers.txt}. In order to increase the quality
	of our footpath model, we also connect stops with footpaths if they are within $600$ meters to each other.
	
	However, our footpaths need to fulfill strong properties (see \sectionref{timetable_sec}), which the given
	transfers usually not obey. Therefore, we have to add self-loop footpaths, if not present. And we need to compute
	the transitive closure of the given footpaths in order to ensure that they are transitively closed. Therefore, it is
	crucial that the range, for which close stops are connected, is kept low. Else, the amount of footpaths dramatically increases
	due to the transitive closure.
	
	The \textit{triangle inequality} property is ensured by rejecting given transfer durations and approximating all durations by using $\asTheCrowFlies$.
	Additionally, all footpath durations must not be lower than the transfer buffer used for the self-loop footpaths. We do so by taking the
	$\max$ of the transfer buffer and the calculated duration.

%Experiments
\subsection{Experiments}
	This section shows our experimental results for the algorithms presented in \sectionref{nearestNeighborProblem}
	and \sectionref{shortestPathProblem}. The algorithms are implemented in the context of the \cobweb \libref{cobweb} project,
	which is an open-source \multiModal route planner written in \java.\\\\
	Results are measured from a sequential execution on a $6$-core Intel Xeon E5649 machine running at $2.53$ GHz.
	The maximal heap size of {\java}s virtual machine is restricted to $85$ GB.

%Nearest neighbor computation
\subsubsection{Nearest neighbor computation}
	For solving the \nearestNeighborProblem we implemented a \coverTree data-structure with corresponding retrieval methods,
	as explained in \sectionref{coverTree}. It operates on nodes of the road network obtained from the data sets
	\freiburgR, \stuttgartR and \switzerlandR, using $\asTheCrowFlies$ as metric on the nodes.\\\\
	The experiment contains of continuous insertion of nodes, for each of the three networks respectively, and then measuring
	random nearest neighbor queries, i.e. the execution time of \algoref{coverTreeSearch}. Measurements are done for tree sizes
	of $1$, $10\,000$ and then in steps of $10\,000$. Each measurement is averaged over $1\,000$ queries using randomly selected nodes.\\
	% Cover tree results
	\begin{figure}[!ht]
		 \begin{center}
			\includegraphics[scale=0.55,angle=-90]{res/plots/coverTreeResults}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Query durations for \algoref{coverTreeSearch} in a \coverTree with increasing size,
		for three road networks respectively. Measurements are done at a size of $1$, $10\,000$ and then in steps
		of $10\,000$, averaged over $1\,000$ random queries. Running time is stated in milliseconds.}
		\label{coverTreeResults}
	\end{figure}\quad\\
	\figref{coverTreeResults} shows the results of the experiment. The method is comparably fast, even for large road
	networks like \switzerlandR. The graph appears to be similar for all three data sets. This is obviously due to the fact that
	they all represent the same type of network, with a similar distribution of nodes.
	
	In a road network, nodes are typically close to each other and appear in local groups, representing cities and structured
	road segments. In particular, they are not uniformly distributed. A \coverTree benefits from this, as a node can be the
	parent of many other, locally close nodes. And as such, the tree is balanced well, resulting in efficient queries
	that are able to quickly find the correct path in the tree that leads to the nearest neighbor.
	
	Due to the same reason, the running time scales approximately logarithmic with increasing size. Queries take longer, if the
	depth of the tree increases. In a well balanced \coverTree, the depth is logarithmic to its size.

%Uni-modal routing
\subsubsection{Uni-modal routing}
	The first experiment for \uniModal routing compares time independent methods for solving the \shortestPathProblem.
	It measures an implementation of \dijkstra (see \algoref{dijkstra}), the \astar algorithm (see \sectionref{alt})
	using $\asTheCrowFlies$ as heuristic and \alt with the precomputed heuristic shown in \defref{alt_heuristic}.
	
	Queries are performed on the road graphs obtained by the data sets \freiburgR, \stuttgartR and \switzerlandR.
	We choose $50$ random source nodes and then determine the \textit{Dijkstra rank} (see \defref{dijkstraRank})
	for the source nodes to all other nodes in the graph. Source nodes with a bad connectivity are rejected and exchanged
	against another random source node. This is determined by a source node having no node in the graph with a rank of at
	least $2^{15}$ which is only rarely the case for randomly chosen nodes.
	We then choose nodes as destinations that have a Dijkstra of
	\begin{align*}
		2^0, 2^1, \ldots, 2^k
	\end{align*}
	where $k \ge 15$ is the maximal rank all source nodes have in common. By that, the queries cover all types of
	ranges, highlighting how well the algorithms scale with queries of increasing ranges.
	By that, we receive for every rank $2^i$ in total $50$ different queries of which we average the
	measured running time over.\\

	\figref{uniModalTimeIndependentResults} shows the results of the experiment. First of all, it can be seen that all
	three methods do not scale well with queries of increasing ranges. Long range queries, like for a rank of $2^{20}$ or $2^{21}$ range
	from $1$ to $10$ seconds. In fact, the running time scales exponentially for increasing ranges. Further, \astar and \alt are slower
	than \dijkstra for short range queries. This is due to the increased overhead of the modified \dijkstra variants. Both need to
	additionally evaluate their corresponding heuristic on every relaxed edge. However, for mid and, in particular, for long
	range queries, \astar performs similar to \dijkstra and \alt even is about twice as fast. At this point the additional overhead is
	negligible and the benefit of a good heuristic pays off. It can also be seen that $\asTheCrowFlies$, which is used by \astar, is not a good
	heuristic for road networks and does not improve over the ordinary \dijkstra approach, as already explained in \sectionref{alt}.\\

	Furthermore, if \alt is implemented very carefully and optimized, it can outperform \dijkstra earlier. For a comparison, we include the results
	from \libref{routePlanningOverview} of similar measured experiments for highly optimized variants of \dijkstra and other
	techniques for \uniModal time independent route planning in \figref{uniModalTimeIndependentResultsExternal}.
	The results show that {\dijkstra}s performance can be increased by approximately a factor of $1\,000$, compared to our implementation,
	if heavily optimized. However, the running time for long range queries is still not feasible. Fortunately, there exist other approaches
	which tackle this problem, like seen in the figure. The presented algorithms are referenced and briefly explained in \libref{routePlanningOverview}.
	
	Additionally, they give a general overview of \uniModal time independent route planning techniques, comparing their average query time and
	their necessary preprocessing time. We include their overview in \figref{uniModalTimeIndependentResultsExternalOverview}.\\

	The second experiment compares time dependent solutions to the \shortestPathProblem. We measure the performance of an
	adopted \dijkstra variant (see \sectionref{time_dependent_sec}) against \csa (using \algoref{csa_algo}) over the duration of one day,
	with changing time. The experiment is measured for the $10.10.2018$, which is a Wednesday, representing an average day in the schedule
	of the transit network. \dijkstra runs on a realistic time expanded transit graph (see \defref{realisticTransitGraph}) and \csa on a
	timetable (see \defref{timetable}), both obtained from the public transit data of \freiburgR, \stuttgartR and \switzerlandR.
	
	Measurements are taken in steps of $10$ minutes over the whole day, averaged over $50$ randomly chosen queries.
	The only exception is \dijkstra for \switzerlandR, which is done in steps of $30$ minutes, due to very long running times.\\

		\label{uniModalTimeDependentResultsSingle}
	\end{figure}\quad\\
	 The algorithms are compared in \figref{uniModalTimeDependentResultsAll}, with their single performance
	 highlighted by \figref{uniModalTimeDependentResultsSingle}.
	 
	 Both algorithms perform worse if the size of the time schedule increases, roughly increasing by a factor of $10$ for all three data sets.
	 However, \csa runs on \switzerlandR $10$ times faster than \dijkstra on the small schedule of \freiburgR, where \csa even performs better
	 by a factor of $1\,000$. Clearly, \csa outperforms \dijkstra for time dependent routing, making it a very viable choice. \csa can even successfully
	 compete against other approaches designed especially for time dependent route planning, as shown by \libref{csa}.
	 
	 It can also be seen that \csa is subject to the traffic congestion of the time schedule. Yielding better running times in the evening and night
	 from \timef{6}{00}{pm} to \timef{6}{00}{am}, than in the morning, noon and afternoon from \timef{6}{00}{am} to \timef{6}{00}{pm}.
	 This is due to the fact that \csa needs to iterate all connections from a given time, not only relevant connections. In a rush hour, the schedule
	 has way more connections that need to be processed, leading to a worse performance.
	 
	 \dijkstra, on the other hand, only needs to scan connections available from the already processed routes. Thus, it is not affected by traffic
	 congestion as much as \csa and is still more subject to the range of queries, which is not captured by this experiment.
